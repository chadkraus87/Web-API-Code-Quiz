# Web-API-Code-Quiz
A Web API Quiz featuring and about JavaScript. This quiz was created and authored by Chadwick Kraus.

## Description

This webpage contains an interactive quiz of 10 multiple-choice questions about JavaScript. A countdown timer is executed after clicking the Start button and for any incorrect answer, 10 seconds is deducted from the time remaining in the quiz. The quiz will end either when all 10 questions have been answered or time expires. At this point, the user will be asked to enter their initials and redirected to a separate HTML page containing a list of High Scores.

This website follows formatting guidelines, displays use of the Document Object Model, and contains two, separate pages of JavaScript code, as well as a corresponding CSS stylesheet. The JavaScript code has been separated to correspond with their respective HTML pages. The CSS stylesheet contains global styles, as well as styles pertaining to their respective HTML pages.
